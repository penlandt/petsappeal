    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        PETSAppeal is a web-based software solution designed to help pet grooming salons operate more efficiently. Whether you're a solo groomer or run a large multi-location salon, PETSAppeal gives you the tools to manage appointments, clients, pets, staff schedules, and more.
